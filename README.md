# Bixby-SAC-Edited
My own project to slightly alter and improve the Bixby States and Capitals Capsule

I have edited the Bixby Developer's States and Capitals capsule so that some (5 most populated) states now output the population as well as the capital. 

The original can be found here:
https://github.com/bixbydevelopers/capsule-sample-states-and-capitals

States with population (to nearest 1,000 unless stated otherwise):
California (To nearest person)
Texas
Florida
New York
Pennsylvania


KNOWN ERRORS:
Any of the states not listed above will return no data when queried about their population, and instead return an error message. This will be fixed when I have time to add the populations of all the other states.
